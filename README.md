# Task-Management-System
Develop a simple task management dashboard where users can create, update, and delete tasks.
Design a clean and intuitive user interface with sections for pending and completed tasks.
Implement functionality to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.
Include basic authentication (e.g., login form) to secure the dashboard (optional).
Utilize client-side storage (e.g., localStorage) to persist tasks across sessions.
